Sakila Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL
https://github.com/M-Snowy/Sakila-EDA-/blob/main/Sakila.sql

In this project, I made a few queries using the Sakila database sample from MySQL. I only used 6 tables:
- Customer
- Film
- Film_Category
- Category
- Rental
- Inventory

### Questions
-	All films with PG-13 films with rental rate of 2.99 or lower
-	All films that have deleted scenes
-	All active customers
-	Names of customers who rented a movie on 26th July 2005
-	Distinct names of customers who rented a movie on 26th July 2005
-	How many rentals we do on each day?
-	All Sci-fi films in our catalogue
-	Customers and how many movies they rented from us so far?
-	Which movies should we discontinue from our catalogue (less than 5 lifetime rentals)
-	Which movies are not returned yet?
